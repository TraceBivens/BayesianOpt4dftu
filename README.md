## Set up the input file (input.json) before running the code 

The input file contains these parts:
- structure_info : Includes geometry information (such as lattice parameter, lattice vectors, atomic position, etc) of the 
target materials.
  #### Example based on InAs:
    1. Lattice_param and cell: define the 2nd to 5th rows in your POSCAR.
      
      "lattice_param": 6.0584,
        "cell": [
            [
                0.0,
                0.5,
                0.5
            ],
            [
                0.5,
                0.0,
                0.5
            ],
            [
                0.5,
                0.5,
                0.0
            ]
        ]
    2. Atoms: Define the atomic positions of each atom in your system and the initial magnetic moment if there is any.
      
      With SOC:
      "atoms": [
            [
                "In",
                [
                    0,
                    0,
                    0
                ],
                [
                    0,
                    0,
                    1e-06
                ]
            ],
            [
                "As",
                [
                    0.75,
                    0.75,
                    0.75
                ],
                [
                    0,
                    0,
                    1e-06
                ]
            ]
        ]
        
      Without SOC:
        "atoms": [
            [
                "In",
                [
                    0,
                    0,
                    0
                ],
                 1e-06
            ],
            [
                "As",
                [
                    0.75,
                    0.75,
                    0.75
                ],
                 1e-06
            ]
        ]
     So in this case, there are two atoms in the primitive cell which are located at the position `(0,0,0)` and `(0.75, 0.75, 0.75)`. The second term under each atom defines the initial magnetic moment. If the spin-orbit coupling is not included in your calculation, it is just an integer while otherwise it is a (3,) array of each element defines the initial moment of corresponding direction. If the initial moment is 0, it has to be set to a small number to avoid confliction in the ASE.
- general_flags: Includes general flags required in the VASP calculation.
- scf: Flags required particularly in SCF calculation.
- band: Flags required particularly in band structure calculation.
- pbe: Flags required when using PBE as exchange-correlation functional.
- hse: Flags required when using HSE06 as exchange-correlation functional.
The flags can be added or removed. More flag keys can be found in the ASE VASP calculator.

## Installation

* `pip install BayesOpt4dftu`

## Usage
To run the examples in the `example` folder, you need to modify the environment settings in the `example.py` of the selected calculation based on the specs of your system and VASP binary.

I will use `/example/2d` as an example:
  
#### 1. Setting environments
  
  Set the running command for VASP executable
  
      VASP_RUN_COMMAND = 'srun -n 54 vasp_ncl'
      
  Define the VASP output file name.
      
      OUTFILENAME = 'vasp.out'
      
  Define the path direct to the VASP pesudoopotential. (P.S. It should be the directory containing the `potpaw_PBE` folder)
      
      VASP_PP_PATH = '/PATH/TO/THE/PESUDOPOTENTIAL/'
      
#### 2. Arguments options

  `--which_u` defines which element you would like to optimize the U for. For a unary substance, it has to be `(1,)`. For compounds with over 2 elements, you can set each element to 0 or 1 to switch on/off the optimization for that element. For InAs, when optimizing for both In and As, it will be `(1,1)`.
  
  `--br` defines how many bands you would like to include in your $\delta$ band
